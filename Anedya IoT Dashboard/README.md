# Anedya IoT Dashboard

The Anedya IoT cloud allows users to remotely monitor and manage their IoT devices. This dashboard showcases real-time data for humidity and temperature, along with control buttons for operating a fan and a light. These buttons are synchronized with real-time updates, accurately reflecting the current status of the devices.
